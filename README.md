# NLP_Project_LyricLab

Our project is focused on generating lyrics inspired Ed Sheeran. We identify recurring themes, patterns, and structures in his songwriting through multiple algorithms.

Our primary objective is to develop text generation models using Language Model such as N gram, LSTM and Transformer. Additionally, we leverage these models to craft new lyrics in the same style as Ed Sheeran. Model Evaluation is done carefully in order to examine and contrast these lyric-generating language models and determine the most effective approach.

The Ed Sheeran dataset comprises 179 rows and 3 columns, labeled "Song name," "Lyrics Link," and "Lyrics Content." It includes 111 unique songs, with a vocabulary size of over 4000 unique words across all the lyrics. The dataset contains a total of 62,000 plus tokens, representing the total number of words used in the lyrics.
